                    <p>We all struggle to develop habits. We decide one day that we are going to start eating healthy or develop an exercise routine. At the start,  
                        motivation may be high. We may buy a gym membership and start working out everyday or transform our fridge, buying more kale and quinoa in place of ice cream.
                        However, over time the gym visits start to become less and less....and the quinoa gradually becomes replaced with soda and fries. How can we effectively
                        build good habits? James Clear, in his book <i> Atomic Habits</i>, makes the assertion that we do not need to make large, momentous changes in our life but 
                        small incremental ones that gradually push us to our goal.
                    </p></br/>
                    <p>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we 
                        convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or 
                        achieving any other goal, weput pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.
                    </p></br/>
                        <p>Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent is not particularly notable— sometimes it is not even <i>noticeable</i> —but it can be far more meaningful, 
                            especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here is how the math works out: if you can 
                            get 1 percent better each day for one year, you will end up thirty-seven times better by the time you are done. Conversely, if you get 1 
                            percent worse each day for one year, you will decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into 
                            something much more. - James Clear</p>

                    <span class="blog-post-date">October 1, 2022 by Janai Shelton</span><br/><br/>
                    <img width ="200em" style="float:left; margin: .5em;"src="unfair_advantage.jpg"/>
                    <p>I recently finished the book, <i>The Unfair Advantage</i> by Ash Ali and Hassan Kubba. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Ash and Hassan really did 
                        a great job at highlighting that the world of entrepreneurship is really not that different from regular everyday living. People have advantages 
                        in certain aspects of life which other people do not have. It is definitely a book that I would recommend to everyone aspiring to be an entrepreneur to read. 
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Ash and Hassan mention that there are two dominant mindsets to be observed among people. <b>The Fixed Mindset</b> and <b>The Growth Mindset</b>.
                        Where the fixed mindset encages people to believe that all that they have is all that they will ever have. Their intelligence, talents, and other traits are merely 
                        fixed attributes and just that. Whereas people with a growth mindset believe that their traits and attributes can be developed through hard work, perseverance, 
                        good strategies, and the correct habits to grow those attributes.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>Ash and Hassan suggest a middle ground between these two mindsets where you can maintain a balance of self-awareness and self-belief that they call the Reality 
                        Growth Mindset. They describe this reality growth mindset as <q>Having your feet on the ground with your head in the clouds.</q> Where you are the master of your 
                        future.
